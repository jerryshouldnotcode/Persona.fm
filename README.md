# Persona-fm - incomplete, looking to complete this summer

Jeremiah's (initial) second final project for Digital Identity (EME4930).

Tech Stack: React, Vite, Node.js, Express, Spotify API, OpenAI API, Vercel, Git, Railway 

Neat Technical Details I Learned (if you feel inclined)
- migrating from Spotify's implicit grant to PKCE auth: still haven't wrapped my head around
this one, but I guess the site is more secure now 

- Vite's dev-proxy vs Vercel serverless backend (and how to route data separately to both)

- how hyperprecise Spotify requires the client_id and redirect_uri to be (I get it, but trailing whitespace? really?)
