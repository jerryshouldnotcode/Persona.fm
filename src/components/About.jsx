        <p>Ever wondered how companies like Spotify use your data to sell products to you?
            Persona.fm is a web app that uses your Spotify data to create your marketing profile,
            and the kind of ads/products you would be interested in - based on just your music taste!
        </p>

        <p>None of this information is kept in a database, and the Github repo is publicly
            available if you're curious about how I built this. 
            
            Have fun, and feel free to share your results!
